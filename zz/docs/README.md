## About Me

I am a PhD student in the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (my "official" [webpage](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/zhixuan-zhou)). 
My advisor is [Dr. Yang Wang](https://yangwang.ischool.illinois.edu/). 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Hongyi Honor College](http://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), China.  

Previously, I was a visiting researcher at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Dr. Justin Hsu](https://justinh.su/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Dr. Xianghua (Sharon) Ding](https://xianghuading.com/index.html), [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), advised by [Dr. Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/), and the [University of Maryland-College Park](https://www.umd.edu/), advised by [Dr. Furong Huang](http://furong-huang.com/). 
I was a research intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/), [Bytedance](https://www.bytedance.com/en) and [Zall Research Institute of Smart Commerce](http://en.zallcn.com/).  

### <span style="color:blue">Research Interests</span><br/>

I combine quantitative (i.e., text mining, survey) and qualitative (i.e., interview, qualitative content analysis) methods to reveal and tackle gender issues (e.g., stereotypes) and AI ethics issues (e.g., fake news). I've also conducted extensive user research to understand emerging sociotechnical systems, especially social/streaming media and blockchain/Web3.

Drop me a line if you are also interested in gender/AI ethics/social and streaming media/blockchain research!

<span style="color:red">I'm avtively looking for a research internship for Summer 2023!</span><br/>
